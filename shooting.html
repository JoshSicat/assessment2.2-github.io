    <p>When shooting a basketball, you should flex or bend your knees on each shot, move the ball swiftly into the shot pocket, 
        align everything so that the ball and your shooting eye are in a straight line toward the hoop, and then execute the shot.</p>
    <p>When catching the basketball or lifting it into a shot, hand placement on the ball is crucial. The balance hand should be on the side of the basketball, and the shooting hand must be underneath or in front of the ball.</p>
    <p>A one-handed shot is the standard shooting motion in basketball. The dominant hand should be responsible for all aspects of shooting once the balance hand has stabilized the basketball up until just before it is released.
        The secret to becoming a great shooter is repetition. Spend a lot of time shooting to set yourself apart from the other athletes.</p>
