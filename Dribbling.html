    <p>In basketball, the ball handler can dribble to move the ball across the floor while maintaining control.
        A player continuously bounces the ball off the ground with one hand in a similar manner.</p>
    <p>Passing differentiates itself from dribbling since the ball is still under the control of the same player. When a team is on offense, the dribbler is the person with the ball who has the choice to dribble, pass, shoot, or pivot anywhere on the floor.</p>
